# Trino Query UI

A reusable React component for executing queries against Trino. It can be embedded into any react application and configured to proxy requests to a local or remote Trino cluster.

> [!WARNING]
> This package is under heavy development and is not yet recommended for production workloads. Treat the current release as an early-stage demo; production-ready builds and documentation will follow soon.

Implementation details:
* React TypeScript project with Vite
* Uses Node.js v20+
* Monaco editor + ANTLR parser using the Trino language

## Installation

```
npm install trino-query-ui
```

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { QueryEditor } from 'trino-query-ui'
import 'trino-query-ui/dist/index.css'

function MyTrinoApp() {
  return <QueryEditor />
}

export default MyTrinoApp
```


## Development

### Build and Run

1. Install Node.js (v20 or newer) from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
2. Install the dependencies and run the dev server:
```
cd precise
npm install
npm run dev
```

The local URL will be displayed, and you can open it in your browser.

### Set Up Proxying to a Local Trino Instance

Update `vite.config.ts` with the following so that queries can be properly proxied to Trino's query endpoint running on `http://localhost:8080` (or any other path you require).

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/query/',
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/v1': {
        target: 'http://localhost:8080',
        changeOrigin: true,
        secure: false,
      },
    },
  },
  ...
});
```

### Building the Parser

Run `npm run antlr4ng` to build the parser, as configured in **package.json**.

### Linting and Code Formatting

To check code quality and formatting:

```shell
  npm run check
```

This command runs both ESLint and Prettier, as defined in **package.json**.

## Philosophy

This UI's purpose is to provide an environment where, once the cluster is up, you can immediately execute queries and explore data sets. The intended use cases are:
* Initial proof-of-concept queries.
* Exploration of data sets.
* Performance analysis.
* Ad hoc query execution.
* Quickly enabling a data engineering team to start work before other integrations are in place.
* Early demos.

The approach:
1. Direct integration into the Trino UI
   - No need for an additional authentication hop (although it could be added in the future)
   - Authenticates as the user executing the query when using OAuth2
   - Trino does the heavy lifting
2. Remove friction so you can simply write a query
   - Autocomplete understands the Trino language, tables, and columns
   - Provides syntax highlighting and validation
   - Offers a comprehensive catalog explorer
3. Avoid black-box query execution
   - Show progress and execution details. People ask "why is my query slow?" mostly because they only see a spinner for minutes.
   - Link to the Trino Query UI to drill into query performance
   - Show stages and split counts like the Trino console client
4. Keep the experience easy to navigate

### Gaps and Future Direction

* Saving queries and using source control require either backend capabilities in the Trino service or leveraging Trino to write queries as tables.
* No autocomplete for the Trino function list.
* Basic graphing capabilities are still missingâ€”looking at a table alone is not enough even for inspecting data sets.
* No LLM copilot integration yet. Many query UIs implement this poorly, but, done well, it could make query crafting fast and help translate from other query languages.
* Parameters and string replacement are only partly implemented in `SubstitutionEditor` and should support both SQL parameters and string replacement.
