# Trino Query UI

A reusable React component as a query interface for the SQL query engine
[Trino](https://trino.io/). Browse connected catalogs, write SQL queries,
execute the queries and inspect result data all in a web application connected
to your Trino cluster.

The component can be embedded into any React application and configured to proxy
requests to a local or remote Trino cluster.

Find more details including using the component, screenshots, development and
more in our [source code repository](https://github.com/simpligility/trino-query-ui).
